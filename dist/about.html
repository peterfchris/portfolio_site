          <h4>My Background</h4>
          <p>Iâ€™m an Instructional Designer who fell into this field by accident but loved it immediately when I learned how it was a perfect mix of everything I enjoyed most from my previous positions.</p>
          <p>As an onboarding specialist at a law firm, I found it very rewarding training new hires and watching them grow from feeling overwhelmed to competent in just a few weeks.</p>
          <p>As a result, I transitioned into an Instructional Design position at AllenComm, an elearning vendor in Salt Lake City. While there, I received a promotion within my first six months as a result of my work ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I led a team that created over 70 courses while maintaining a faster pace of production than our clients were accustomed to.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed the recent opportunity of starting Integrity First Lending's Learning and Development team, and made a significant impact on their training methods, hiring process, and company culture.</p>
          <p>I'm currently seeking a new opportunity to make an impact as an Instructional Designer.</p>
