     <div class="piece">
      <h3 class="piece-title">Overview</h3>
      <p>I designed a three-course bundle for Fitness for Food Lovers’ clients so they can know how to structure their training and eating program in a way that allows them to enjoy as much of their favorite foods as possible while also achieving their fitness goals. </p>
     </div>

      <h3 class="piece-title">Define</h3>
      <p><strong>What is the business need?</strong></p>
      <p>The business, Fitness for Food Lovers, needed an education product that would establish them as an expert in their industry, offer great value at low cost, and educate their clients on how to eat and train in a way that they could maintain and enjoy to meet their fitness goals.</p>
      <p><strong>Who are the learners?</strong></p>
      <p>The learners are men and women, typically between 30-50, who want to achieve their fitness goals without having to torture themselves by abstaining from their favorite foods.  They mostly vary by category of what they’re trying to accomplish. I created 3 avatars to represent the different groups and developed different versions of the course to cater to each avatar:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>The Burner:</strong> Learners focused on fat loss</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>The Builder:</strong> Learners focused on muscle gains</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>The Refiner:</strong> Learners focused on recomposing muscle-fat ratio while maintaining weight and enjoying higher levels of performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What are the learning gaps?</strong></p>
      <p>To determine the learning gaps, I conducted informational interviews with the company’s trainers and several of their clients. From the interviews, I determined the following gaps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title">Learner believes they have to give up food they love to lose fat/build muscle/be healthy</li>
        <li class="list-title">Learner believes they have to do exercises they hate to lose fat/build muscle/be healthy</li>
        <li class="list-title">Learner believes they have to eat and train a specific way to achieve their goals</li>
        <li class="list-title">Learner believes they can either be good-looking, healthy and miserable or fat and happy</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How will we evaluate success?</strong></p>
      <p>Referring to Kirkpatrick’s 4 levels of evaluation, I wanted to determine easy-to-track metrics that would focus on learners’ behavior and increased business for Fitness for Food Lovers.</p>
      <p><strong>Learner Behavior</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Are the learners achieving their fitness goals?</strong> Are they using any of the methods taught in the course to do so? If so, how? I will obtain this data through tracking software already in place that I will have access to through the owner. </p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Has the course been an effective tool for generating referrals from existing clients?</strong> I saw this product as a relationship-building tool that Ben and his trainers could use to build trust with their clients. I would measure the success of this through tracking how many more referrals come in as a result of this training. I will have access to this data through tracking software that’s already in place, which I will have access to through the owner.</p>

      <h3 class="piece-title">Design</h3>
      <p><strong>Design Challenge</strong></p>
      <p>The challenge I faced with this course was deciding how I could deliver the content in a way that would address the three learner groups effectively.</p>
      <p><strong>Design Thinking Behind the Deliverables</strong></p>
      <p>Theories and models I found helpful in designing these courses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>SAM</Strong> <ul>
          <li>To keep this project on track, it’s crucial to manage the timeline well. I often reference the SAM model to help expedite the course production process.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>ADDIE</Strong> <ul>
          <li>I don’t typically think of ADDIE as a model, but more of a dictionary that’s good to reference to make sure I didn’t miss anything important.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Kirkpatrick’s Levels</Strong> <ul>
          <li>I’ve always found this model useful for setting up evaluation.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Gagne's 9 Events</Strong> <ul>
          <li>While I don’t think all nine events apply for every learning experience, I find this a useful framework for mapping out activity types and how to sequence them.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Micro-Learning</Strong> <ul>
          <li>I find this concept especially important in the online space, since learners face a great deal more opportunity for distraction.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>

       <p class='piece-list-title'><strong>Deliverables</strong> </p>
       <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Web-Based Courses</Strong> <ul>
          <li>Since the learners live across the US, and factoring in the budget, timeline, scope, and intention of this course, using a web-based format was the best option. The course includes the following elements:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="list-title piece-list-title"><Strong>Motion Graphics: </Strong>I scripted, storyboarded, recorded, and edited 5 motion graphics for the course to keep the content fun and engaging.</li>
            <li class="list-title piece-list-title"><Strong>Knowledge Checks and Assessments: </Strong>I’m including an assessment before and after the course to determine how well the content was delivered. I include several knowledge checks after trickier concepts to make sure the learners understood the information provided.</li>
            <li class="list-title piece-list-title"><Strong>Interactive Activities: </Strong>To keep the learning experience fun and engaging, I used a variety of activity templates in Articulate Rise to make the content more interesting and easier to understand.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Field Guide</Strong> <ul>
          <li>Downloadable PDF includes journal prompts to help the learner track their progress and self-assessments to help learners self-evaluate their success.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Cheat Sheet</Strong> <ul>
          <li>Downloadable PDF that learners can easily refer to after the learning experience if needed.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./img/fffl_field_guide.png" alt="">
      <p class='piece-list-title'><strong>Tools Used</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>Articulate: </strong>To create the web-based training</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>Photoshop: </strong>To create images and graphics for activities in course and field guide</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>Illustrator: </strong>to create graphics for Flavor Star and Flavor Profile Chart</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>InDesign: </strong>To create the PDF deliverables</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>After Effects: </strong>To create the motion graphics</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>SoundForge: </strong>To edit the audio for the motion graphics and a fake podcast episode for one of the activities</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>Word: </strong>To script the course, videos, motion graphic, and PDFs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="piece-title">Deliver</h3>
      <p class='piece-list-title'><strong>Business Impact</strong></p>
      <p>While this course has not yet launched, it has already had a positive impact on the business by providing content that’s easily repurposed for marketing on YouTube as well as providing a more organized approach to Fitness for Food Lovers’ coaching process. Ben Johnson, owner of Fitness for Food Lovers, has helped his clients achieve their fitness goals more effectively and increased his client acquisition through advertising campaigns on social media and search engines as a direct result of this course.</p>
      <p>The owner, Ben Johnson, was kind enough to write the following:</p>
      <p><em>“Working with Peter is fantastic. Not only did he consistently deliver high-level and quality work, but he also exceeded my expectations at every turn. He was invaluable.”</em> -Ben M. Johnson, Owner at <strong>Fitness for Food Lovers</strong></p>
