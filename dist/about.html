          <h4>My Background</h4>
          <p>I’m an Instructional Designer who fell into this field by accident but loved it immediately when I learned how it was a perfect mix of everything I enjoyed most from my previous positions.</p>
          <p>As an onboarding specialist at a law firm, I found it very rewarding training new hires and watching them grow from feeling overwhelmed to competent in just a few weeks.</p>
          <p>Before that position, I worked in marketing and advertising, where I enjoyed researching target audiences, and designing deliverables based off their perspective. </p>
          <p>Because of my passion for this field, during my first six months at AllenComm, I was able to grow from writing assistant to project lead on multiple accounts including Morgan Stanley, ACM, and E*TRADE where I produced deliverables for over 100,000 learners collectively.</p>
