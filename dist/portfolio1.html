       <h3 class="piece-title">Background</h3>
       <p class='piece-list-title'>Over an 18 month period, I worked as a content creator and instructional designer figuring out how to provide Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors with the tools they needed—both psychologically and technologically—to be successful in their careers, whether their goals were to advance to a higher position, provide better service for their clients, learn a new technology, or prepare for retirement. As part of this role, I frequently met with the client to coordinate our design efforts, and communicated with the other teams—programming, graphic design, and video editing—to ensure we provided a quality product while also meeting our deadlines. </p>

     <div class="piece">
      <h3 class="piece-title">Design Challenge</h3>
      <p class='piece-list-title'>We constantly faced two challenges with these courses: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing eLearning courses that were intuitive to navigate for an audience that was not familiar with technology</li>
        <li>Transforming highly technical information into small, easy-to-comprehend pieces that still contained a comprehensive view of the learning material</li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <div class="piece">
       <h3 class="piece-title">Process</h3>
       <p class='piece-list-title'>My role with Morgan Stanley grew out of necessity over the course of two years. Starting in late 2019, I filled the role of part-time Instructional Writer, acting as an assistant to the Instructional Designer over Morgan Stanley. After a few months, I took over the Morgan Stanley account as a full time eLearning Developer, filling the role of both Writer and Instructional Designer. As an eLearning Developer, my responsibilities fell into three main categories:</p>
       <ul>
         <li class="list-title"><Strong>Team Management</Strong> <ul>
           <li>As the lead on Morgan Stanley, I had to coordinate with our video production, graphic design, and web development teams to meet the demands of the Morgan Stanley account, often on tight deadlines.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li class="list-title"><Strong>Course Development</Strong> <ul>
           <li>Taking on the responsibility of the Instructional Design role, I had to quickly learn the ins and outs of Allencomm’s course production software, DesignLab. I also had to understand eLearning principles and models (ADDIE, SAM, etc) to produce a high-quality learning experience for the Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li class="list-title"><Strong>Client Coordination</Strong> <ul>
           <li>I met with Morgan Stanley’s team of subject matter experts (SMEs) once or twice each week to report our progress, clarify missing or ambiguous feedback from the client, offer potential solutions and advise them on concerns or challenges they had.</li>
         </ul></li>
       </ul>

     </div>
     <div class="piece">
       <h3 class="piece-title">Business Impact</h3>
       <p>The courses I created have been taken by over 25,000 Morgan Stanley employees across two continents, and over 10,000 have received specialized certifications that have allowed them to obtain promotions, grow their businesses and income.</p>
