          <h4>My Background</h4>
          <p>I got my start in the eLearning space working as an Instructional Writer for Allen Communications in the summer of 2019. As my role and responsibilities at Allen Communications grew, I soon realized the field aligned well with my passions for writing, education, and technology. </p>
          <p>As my desire to become an expert in Instructional Design grew, I started networking with other eLearning professionals and soon landed my first freelance project. While leading the team on one of Allen Communications most complex client accounts and building smaller projects in my free time, I've gained a deeper understanding of elearning theories and how to apply them in real world scenarios.</p>
          <p>I've also invested a good portion of my time over the past two years expanding my technical toolkit so I could better manage the other teams I work with. The technologies I use regularly include multimedia tools for image, audio, and video production, basic coding, and eLearning development tools such as Storyline and Captivate.</p>
