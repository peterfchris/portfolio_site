       <h3 class="piece-title">Background</h3>
       <p class='piece-list-title'>Fitness for Food Lovers (FFFL), an online fitness coaching business, needed an online version of their coaching program that would educate their clients on how to enjoy achieving their fitness goals without losing the quality of experience their current 1-on-1 coaching model provides. By consulting with the owner of FFFL, Ben M. Johnson, I identified the most common learning gaps of his clients as well as the key benefits of his coaching method. Once I had this information, I addressed it by designing a two-course Web-Based Training (WBT) bundle so that each course could focus on one of the fundamental challenges of his learners how to cook and how to train.</p>

     <div class="piece">
      <h3 class="piece-title">Design Challenge</h3>
      <p class='piece-list-title'>The Fitness for Food Lovers course needed to address common fitness learning gaps while also maintaining the quality of experience that comes from FFFL’s 1-on-1 training. I consulted with FFFL’s owner, Ben M. Johnson, as well as 50 of his clients to determine the most common learning gaps and key benefits of following FFFL’s method. I was able to identify the following gaps and benefits of his coaching style:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Fitness Training Learning Gaps:</Strong> <ul>
          <li>Learner believes they have to give up food they love to lose fat/build muscle/be healthy</li>
          <li>Learner believes they have to do exercises they hate to lose fat/build muscle/be healthy</li>
          <li>Learner believes they have to eat and train a specific way to achieve their goals</li>
          <li>Learner believes they can either be good-looking, healthy and miserable or fat and happy</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Cooking Learning Gaps:</Strong> <ul>
          <li>Learner doesn’t know what to eat to be healthy</li>
          <li>Learner doesn’t know how to fix flavors that are slightly off</li>
          <li>Learner doesn’t know how to cook food that is both delicious and healthy</li>
          <li>Learner doesn’t know how to present their food to dinner guests in a way that is impressive and not amateurish</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Key Benefits:</Strong> <ul>
          <li><strong>Physical fulfillment:</strong> Clients using FFFL’s method can achieve their fitness goals while still eating the foods they love</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Clients aren’t given a strict plan to follow. Instead, they are offered a buffet of fitness strategies and are asked to pick the ones they would enjoy most</li>
          <li><strong>Self-paced:</strong> Clients set their own timelines, goals and methods to achieve them</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Another element that needed to be addressed besides those listed above, is that the training course attracts learners with very different goals—some wish to build muscle and grow bigger while others want to burn fat and lose weight.</p>
      <p>To address each of the learning gaps, benefits, and the owner’s concerns, I designed a two-course Web-Based Training (WBT) bundle—one to focus on training, the other to focus on cooking.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Training Course</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><p>To address the different learners that would be attracted to the course, I used principles of gamification to create three tracks for the course, each represented by three avatars that embodied the three different types of learners. The learner, selecting the track that most applies to them, will be able to receive the content written, designed, and sequenced to be specific to their type of goal. The three avatars are as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>The Burner:</strong>those focused on fat loss</li>
                <li><strong>The Builder:</strong>those focused on muscle gains</li>
                <li><strong>The Refiner:</strong>those focused on increased general fitness</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The sequence of activities as well as the content of the course modules addressed each of the learning gaps identified. By creating the course as a WBT, I was able to provide FFFL’s clients with the flexibility they currently enjoy under the old business model as well as the self-paced experience of pursuing their fitness goals. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Cooking Course</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The design challenge of the cooking course was figuring out how to deliver the incredibly complex material, which was as much an art form as a science, in a way that would be easy and quick to digest while also providing enough specific information that the learner would be able to apply the material immediately after finishing the course. To address this challenge, I used principles of micro learning and blended learning. By using micro learning methods, I was able to distill the complex information into small, bite size chunks. By using blended learning, I created text, test questions, easy-to-access reference material, audio, video, and motion graphics to make the course interesting as well as educational.</p></li>

       <h3 class="piece-title">Process</h3>
       <p class='piece-list-title'>For this project, I followed a specific process to minimize the cost of production while also delivering a highly informative, quality product.</p>
       <ul>
         <li class="list-title"><Strong>1st Iteration: Design and Content Creation</Strong> <ul>
           <li>During this phase, I met with the client every week to review the week’s results and coordinate the next weeks efforts. I would guide these discussions to narrow in on learning gaps (how to achieve fitness goals without torturing oneself through food deprivation and unenjoyable exercises), and write out the content for the various learning activities to address those gaps. We would also review potential activities that would best deliver the content for each module.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li class="list-title"><Strong>2nd Iteration: Media Production</Strong> <ul>
           <li>During this phase, the client flew in to Salt Lake so we could film the six videos, and record the audio for the fake podcast episodes and motion graphics that would be included in the two courses. After the film shoot and recording sessions, I edited the audio and video using tools like Premier Pro and Sound Forge. I also created the artwork for the motion graphics using Photoshop and Illustrator, and produced the motion graphics using After Effects. I created cheat sheets for the 5 categories of flavors, flavor profiles for cuisines around the world, a workbook to track exercises, and a cheat sheet for the different principles of training using Word, Excel, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li class="list-title"><Strong>3rd Iteration: Course Development</Strong> <ul>
           <li>I am currently putting the course together using Articulate, including the programs Storyline and Rise.</li>
         </ul></li>
       </ul>

     <div class="piece">
       <h3 class="piece-title">Business Impact</h3>
       <p>While this course has not yet launched, it has already had a positive impact on the business by providing content that’s easily repurposed for marketing as well as providing a more organized approach to Fitness for Food Lover’s coaching process. Ben Johnson, owner of Fitness for Food Lovers, has helped his clients achieve their fitness goals more effectively and increased his client acquisition through advertising campaigns on social media and search engines as a direct result of this course. Speaking of working with me, he was kind enough to write the following:</p>
       <p class="quote"><em>“Working with Peter is fantastic. Not only did he consistently deliver high-level and quality work, but he also exceeded my expectations at every turn. He was invaluable.”</em> -Ben M. Johnson, Owner at Fitness for Food Lovers</p>
