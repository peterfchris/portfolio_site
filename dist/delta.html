      <h3 class="piece-title">Overview</h3>
      <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Link to the course is unavailable and images are blurred to comply with Allen Communication's client confidentiality agreement.</p></em>
      <p>I designed, developed, and scripted a blended learning environment to help Delta Airlines transition their onboarding program from an in-person live training to an online format. This training reduced the onboarding time for Delta’s reservation specialists from six weeks to two and a half weeks while maintaining quality of new hire performance as assessed by Delta’s internal metrics.</p>

      <h3 class="piece-title">Define</h3>
      <p><strong>What is the business need?</strong></p>
      <p>Delta wished to transition into an online format to reduce the risk of COVID among new hires and to expedite the amount of onboarding time needed if possible.</p>
      <p><strong>Who are the learners?</strong></p>
      <p>Newly hired reservation specialists at Delta.</p>
      <p><strong>What are the learning gaps?</strong></p>
      <p>The learners are not familiar with the software, customer service best practices, or company and DOT policies that affect their jobs.</p>
      <p><strong>How will we evaluate success?</strong></p>
      <p>We determined the success of the training by Delta’s internal metrics for job performance and compared those results to the outcomes of the in-person facilitations it replaced.</p>

      <h3 class="piece-title">Design</h3>
      <p><strong>Design Challenge</strong></p>
      <p>The main challenge we focused on was maintaining the quality of engagement in a virtual environment. To address this, we opted for a blended environment where the training still had the benefit of high engagement with a live facilitator as well as the flexibility of a self-paced web-based training.</p>
      <p><strong>Design Thinking Behind the Deliverables</strong></p>
      <p>Theories and models I found helpful in designing these courses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>ADDIE</Strong> <ul>
          <li>I don’t typically think of ADDIE as a model, but more of a dictionary that’s good to reference to make sure I didn’t miss anything important.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Kirkpatrick’s Levels</Strong> <ul>
          <li>I’ve always found this model useful for setting up evaluation.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Cognitivism</Strong> <ul>
          <li>Cognitivism is one of the most important aspects to consider with virtual trainings because it’s much more difficult to maintain engagement in a remote environment. This helped us parse out the information into small, manageable pieces that allowed the learner to have an easier time approaching the content.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Micro-Learning</Strong> <ul>
          <li>I find this concept especially important in the online space, since learners face a great deal more opportunity for distraction.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <div class="piece">
      <img src="./img/Delta_3.png" alt="">
       <h3 class="piece-title">Develop</h3>
       <p class='piece-list-title'><strong>Deliverables</strong> </p>
       <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><Strong>Blended Learning Environment</Strong> <ul>
          <li>To combine the flexibility of a self-paced, virtual environment with the engagement of an instructor-led training, we opted for a blended learning environment comprised of a Virtual Instructor-Led Training (vILT) and a web-based training (WBT).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class='piece-list-title'><strong>Tools Used</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>DesignLab: </strong>Proprietary tool used to create the web-based trainings</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>PowerPoint: </strong>Used to create the presentation materials for the instructors.</li>
        <li class="list-title"><strong>Word: </strong>Used to create the job aids and study materials.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="piece-title">Deliver</h3>
      <p class='piece-list-title'><strong>Business Impact</strong></p>
      <p>The course has reduced Delta’s onboarding time for their reservation specialists by +50% and created a virtual learning experience to fight the battle against COVID. Due to a dedicated and highly collaborative team effort, we were able to deliver this project on-time while using less than 70% of the budget.</p>
